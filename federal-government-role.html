      <p>Since the late 19th century, the federal government has played an increasingly active role in shaping the American economy. From regulating industries and protecting labor to launching social welfare programs and managing fiscal crises, government intervention has expanded in response to major economic and social challenges.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Periods and Developments</div>

      <h3>The Progressive Era (1890s–1920s)</h3>
      <p>Regulations like the Sherman Antitrust Act and the creation of the Federal Reserve reflected growing concern over corporate monopolies and economic stability.</p>

      <h3>The New Deal (1930s)</h3>
      <p>In response to the Great Depression, FDR launched expansive programs under the New Deal to create jobs, reform banking, and provide economic security. Social Security, the FDIC, and the SEC were all created during this period.</p>

      <h3>The Great Society (1960s)</h3>
      <p>Lyndon B. Johnson’s domestic agenda expanded the welfare state with Medicare, Medicaid, and anti-poverty programs like Head Start and food assistance.</p>

      <h3>Reagan Era and Deregulation (1980s)</h3>
      <p>Conservatives pushed to reduce the size of government, lower taxes, and cut regulation. This marked a shift toward free-market policies and a more limited federal role.</p>

      <h3>Post-2008 Financial Crisis and Beyond</h3>
      <p>The federal government again expanded its influence through stimulus spending, financial regulation (e.g., Dodd-Frank), and later COVID-era relief programs like PPP loans and the CARES Act.</p>

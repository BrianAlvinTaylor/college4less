        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The separation of powers is a foundational principle of American constitutional design. It divides the powers of government among three branches—legislative, executive, and judicial—each with distinct responsibilities. This framework is intended to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power and to enable a system of checks and balances.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legislative Powers:</strong> Congress holds the power to make laws, approve budgets, declare war, and oversee the executive branch.</li>
          <li><strong>Executive Powers:</strong> The President is responsible for enforcing laws, directing foreign policy, and acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</li>
          <li><strong>Judicial Powers:</strong> The courts interpret laws and can strike down unconstitutional acts through judicial review, as established in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> (1803).</li>
          <li><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> Each branch has tools to limit the others—for example, presidential vetoes, Senate confirmations, and judicial review.</li>
        </ul>

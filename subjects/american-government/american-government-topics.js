        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The separation of powers is a foundational principle of American constitutional design. It divides the powers of government among three branches—legislative, executive, and judicial—each with distinct responsibilities. This framework is intended to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power and to enable a system of checks and balances.</p>

        <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legislative Powers:</strong> Congress holds the power to make laws, approve budgets, declare war, and oversee the executive branch.</li>
          <li><strong>Executive Powers:</strong> The President is responsible for enforcing laws, directing foreign policy, and acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</li>
          <li><strong>Judicial Powers:</strong> The courts interpret laws and can strike down unconstitutional acts through judicial review, as established in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> (1803).</li>
          <li><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> Each branch has tools to limit the others—for example, presidential vetoes, Senate confirmations, and judicial review.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
        <p>Remember that separation of powers isn't just about structure—it’s about conflict and cooperation. Focus on how the branches hold each other accountable to maintain a balance of authority.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The foundations of American democracy are rooted in Enlightenment ideas about natural rights, popular sovereignty, and the social contract. These principles shaped the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, forming the basis for the American political system.</p>

        <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>

          <li><strong>Natural Rights:</strong> Inspired by John Locke, these include life, liberty, and property, which governments are created to protect.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Contract:</strong> The idea that government power derives from the consent of the governed.</li>
          <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> The authority of the government comes from the people.</li>
          <li><strong>Declaration of Independence (1776):</strong> Articulated grievances against the British crown and established the United States as a free nation.</li>
          <li><strong>Influence of Enlightenment Thinkers:</strong> Philosophers like Montesquieu and Rousseau shaped American ideals about liberty and governance.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Campaigns and elections are essential to democratic accountability, allowing citizens to choose representatives and influence public policy. The media plays a central role in informing voters, shaping public opinion, and setting the political agenda. Understanding how these elements interact is key to analyzing modern American politics.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Electoral Systems:</strong> The United States uses a plurality, winner-take-all system for most elections. This favors the two-party system and affects campaign strategies and voter behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Presidential vs. Congressional Campaigns:</strong> Presidential races are national in scope, heavily media-driven, and decided through the Electoral College. Congressional races focus on local issues and often rely on incumbency advantages.</li>
        <li><strong>Campaign Finance:</strong> Federal law regulates donations and expenditures. Key legislation includes the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA). <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> (2010) allowed unlimited independent political spending by corporations and unions.</li>
        <li><strong>Role of Media:</strong> Media functions include reporting news, investigating corruption, interpreting events, and acting as a political watchdog. New media, including social media, has transformed how campaigns are run and how voters engage.</li>
        <li><strong>Voter Behavior and Turnout:</strong> Influenced by factors such as party identification, issue salience, media exposure, and candidate image. Negative ads, debates, and last-minute news cycles can all impact election outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Polling and the Horse Race:</strong> The media often emphasizes who's winning (the "horse race") over policy substance. Polls influence campaign strategy and voter perception but must be evaluated critically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Political parties and interest groups are essential intermediaries between the public and the government. They organize political activity, influence policy decisions, and mobilize voters. While parties seek control of government through elections, interest groups aim to shape legislation and policy outcomes without fielding candidates.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functions of Political Parties:</strong> Recruit candidates, coordinate campaigns, develop platforms, and organize government. Parties help voters interpret political information and simplify electoral choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Party System:</strong> The U.S. primarily operates under a two-party system due to winner-take-all elections. Third parties rarely win but can influence major party platforms and bring attention to overlooked issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Party Realignment and Dealignment:</strong> Realignments mark significant shifts in voter bases (e.g., the New Deal coalition), while dealignment reflects increased numbers of independents and split-ticket voting.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Groups:</strong> Organizations that lobby for specific policy goals. They include business groups, labor unions, public interest groups, and professional associations (e.g., AARP, NRA).</li>
        <li><strong>Lobbying and Influence:</strong> Interest groups influence policy through lobbying legislators, testifying at hearings, sponsoring litigation, and contributing to campaigns via PACs and Super PACs.</li>
        <li><strong>Iron Triangles and Issue Networks:</strong> Interest groups, congressional committees, and bureaucratic agencies form alliances to influence policy. Issue networks represent looser, broader coalitions that include experts and media.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Understand the difference between political parties and interest groups. Be able to explain how each seeks to influence government and how iron triangles shape policymaking. CLEP questions may ask about realignment, lobbying tactics, or third-party roles.</p>

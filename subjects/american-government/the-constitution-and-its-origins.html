      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The U.S. Constitution emerged from the failure of the Articles of Confederation and the need for a stronger, more effective national government. Drafted in 1787, the Constitution created a federal system with three separate branches, establishing the framework for American government and codifying the balance of power between national and state authority.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Articles of Confederation:</strong> The first U.S. governing document (1781–1789), which created a weak central government with no power to tax, regulate trade, or enforce laws. Its failure led to calls for a stronger national framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Shays' Rebellion (1786–87):</strong> A grassroots uprising in Massachusetts that exposed the weaknesses of the Articles and prompted national leaders to convene the Constitutional Convention.</li>
        <li><strong>Constitutional Convention (1787):</strong> Held in Philadelphia, the convention replaced the Articles with a new Constitution. Delegates debated state representation, slavery, and the powers of federal government.</li>
        <li><strong>Great Compromise:</strong> Merged the Virginia Plan (population-based representation) and New Jersey Plan (equal state representation) to create a bicameral legislature: House of Representatives and Senate.</li>
        <li><strong>Three-Fifths Compromise:</strong> Allowed states to count three out of every five enslaved persons for representation and taxation, reflecting deep divisions over slavery.</li>
        <li><strong>Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists:</strong> Federalists supported the new Constitution; Anti-Federalists opposed it, fearing central power. The Bill of Rights was added to secure ratification and protect individual liberties.</li>
        <li><strong>Ratification and Federalism:</strong> The Constitution took effect in 1789 and created a federal system of government, dividing powers between the national and state levels. Article VI established national supremacy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Understand why the Articles of Confederation failed and how compromises at the Constitutional Convention shaped the final document. Know the roles of major figures like Madison and Hamilton, and how the Federalist Papers defended the new government.</p>

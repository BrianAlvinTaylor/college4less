    <h1>Foundations of American Democracy</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The foundations of American democracy are rooted in Enlightenment philosophies that emphasized natural rights, social contracts, and government accountability. These ideas greatly influenced the creation of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, establishing principles that continue to shape American government today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Rights:</strong> John Locke argued that all individuals are born with rights to life, liberty, and property — a foundation for Jefferson’s words in the Declaration of Independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Contract Theory:</strong> Governments are formed through an agreement between the people and their rulers. If a government fails to protect rights, citizens have the right to replace it.</li>
        <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> Political power resides with the people, a key idea in both the Declaration and the preamble to the Constitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Republicanism:</strong> The American system favors representation over direct democracy, where elected leaders govern in the public interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Declaration of Independence (1776):</strong> This document justified American independence using Enlightenment ideals and outlined grievances against King George III.</li>
        <li><strong>Influence of Montesquieu and Rousseau:</strong> Ideas like separation of powers and consent of the governed shaped the structure of the U.S. Constitution.</li>
      </ul>

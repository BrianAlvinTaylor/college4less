      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The foundations of American democracy are built on Enlightenment ideas and historical documents that shaped the nation’s political identity. Key concepts like natural rights, the social contract, and separation of powers influenced both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
  <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Rights and John Locke:</strong> John Locke’s Enlightenment philosophy emphasized that individuals are born with inherent rights to life, liberty, and property. These ideas directly influenced Thomas Jefferson’s phrasing in the Declaration of Independence and underpin the notion that rights are not granted by government but must be protected by it.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Contract Theory:</strong> Developed by philosophers like Locke and Rousseau, this theory proposes that governments exist based on the consent of the governed. Citizens agree to form governments to protect their rights, and they retain the authority to withdraw that consent if the government becomes tyrannical or unjust.</li>
    <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> This principle holds that legitimate political power derives from the will of the people. It is embodied in the phrase "We the People" in the Constitution’s Preamble and shaped the democratic foundations of U.S. government by reinforcing majority rule with protections for minority rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Montesquieu and Separation of Powers:</strong> French political theorist Montesquieu argued for dividing governmental authority among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The U.S. Constitution reflects this structure in Articles I–III, ensuring no single branch could dominate and preserving liberty through institutional checks and balances.</li>
    <li><strong>Republicanism:</strong> American republicanism prioritizes representative government, where citizens elect officials to deliberate and make laws on their behalf. This system balances efficiency with accountability and avoids the risks of direct democracy while honoring democratic principles.</li>
    <li><strong>The Declaration of Independence (1776):</strong> Authored primarily by Jefferson, this document justified colonial independence from Britain. It incorporated Enlightenment ideas by asserting universal natural rights, listing grievances against King George III, and asserting the right of revolution against unjust rule.</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Be able to connect Enlightenment thinkers to principles found in founding documents. Match Locke with natural rights, Montesquieu with separation of powers, and Rousseau with popular sovereignty. These appear often in CLEP exam questions.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws and administering government. At its head is the President, a uniquely powerful figure in both domestic and foreign policy. The role, powers, limitations, and interactions of the presidency with other branches are central to understanding American governance.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constitutional Powers:</strong> Article II of the Constitution outlines presidential duties: commander-in-chief of the armed forces, veto power, treaty negotiation, appointment of federal officials, and faithful execution of the laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Checks on Presidential Power:</strong> Congressional oversight, the power of the purse, the impeachment process, and judicial review all constrain executive authority. War Powers Resolution (1973) also limits military action without congressional approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Executive Orders and Agreements:</strong> Executive orders direct federal agencies and carry the force of law without congressional approval. Executive agreements, unlike treaties, do not require Senate ratification.</li>
        <li><strong>Cabinet and Executive Office:</strong> The President’s Cabinet includes department heads who advise on policy and implementation. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) includes the National Security Council, OMB, and others crucial to daily administration.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth of Presidential Power:</strong> Over time, especially during crises like the Great Depression and wartime, the scope of presidential power has expanded through both constitutional interpretation and precedent.</li>
        <li><strong>Presidential Elections:</strong> The Electoral College determines the outcome, not the popular vote directly. Swing states, campaign strategy, and the winner-take-all system play pivotal roles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Be able to distinguish between formal (constitutional) and informal powers of the presidency, and understand how executive actions like orders and agreements differ from laws and treaties. The CLEP may also test your knowledge of historical shifts in presidential authority.</p>

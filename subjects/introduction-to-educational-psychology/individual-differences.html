      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Individual differences refer to the diverse abilities, traits, and learning needs that students bring to the classroom. These include variations in intelligence, learning styles, background experiences, and exceptionalities such as giftedness or learning disabilities. Understanding and addressing individual differences is essential for equity, inclusion, and effective instruction.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Often measured by IQ tests; includes multiple perspectives such as Gardner’s multiple intelligences and Sternberg’s triarchic theory.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic and Environmental Influences:</strong> Both heredity and environment shape intelligence and learning; the interaction is complex and dynamic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Styles and Preferences:</strong> While controversial, awareness of how students prefer to process information may support engagement when used flexibly.</li>
        <li><strong>Exceptionalities:</strong> Includes giftedness, learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia), and behavioral/emotional disorders; each requires specific instructional accommodations.</li>
        <li><strong>Ability Grouping and Tracking:</strong> Grouping students by perceived ability; may help differentiate instruction but can reinforce inequities if misused.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity and Inclusion:</strong> Teachers must balance challenge and support for diverse learners through differentiated instruction and Universal Design for Learning (UDL).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p><strong>Exceptionalities</strong> are conditions that significantly impact how a student learns and interacts in the classroom. These may include giftedness, ADHD, autism, or specific learning disabilities like dyslexia. Teachers must recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach fails many students. The best practice is to use differentiated instruction that allows flexibility in content, process, and assessment to meet varied student needs.</p>

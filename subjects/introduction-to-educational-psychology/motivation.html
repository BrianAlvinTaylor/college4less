      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Motivation in educational psychology refers to the internal processes that activate, guide, and sustain behavior toward learning goals. Educators use motivation theories to understand what drives students to engage, persist, and succeed in school. Theories like expectancy-value, goal orientation, attribution, and self-determination help explain the differences in student motivation and inform strategies to foster intrinsic interest and resilience.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation:</strong> Intrinsic comes from interest in the task itself; extrinsic is driven by rewards or external pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribution Theory:</strong> Explains how students interpret success or failure — stable/unstable, internal/external, controllable/uncontrollable.</li>
        <li><strong>Expectancy-Value Theory:</strong> Motivation is strongest when students believe they can succeed (expectancy) and value the outcome (value).</li>
        <li><strong>Goal Orientation Theory:</strong> Mastery goals (focus on learning) vs. performance goals (focus on demonstrating ability) affect effort and persistence.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Efficacy:</strong> The belief in one's ability to succeed; higher self-efficacy leads to greater motivation and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Determination Theory:</strong> Emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness as key to fostering intrinsic motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong> A belief that effort won’t lead to success, often rooted in repeated failure or negative reinforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Teacher Expectations:</strong> Also called the Pygmalion effect — when high expectations lead to improved performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p><strong>Self-efficacy</strong> is one of the most powerful predictors of student motivation. When learners believe they can succeed, they’re more likely to persist through challenges. Teachers can build self-efficacy by offering appropriate challenge, positive feedback, and opportunities for success. Understanding the difference between mastery and performance goals also helps educators guide students toward deeper, more meaningful engagement with learning tasks.</p>

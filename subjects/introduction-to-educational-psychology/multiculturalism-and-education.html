      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Multiculturalism in education refers to the inclusion and consideration of students’ diverse cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and identity backgrounds in teaching and learning. It emphasizes equity, respect, and representation, aiming to reduce systemic biases and promote inclusive classroom environments. Educators must be aware of how culture shapes behavior, communication, and learning expectations.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ethnic, Racial, and Cultural Diversity:</strong> Understanding and valuing cultural differences enhances student connection and academic success.</li>
        <li><strong>Socioeconomic Status (SES):</strong> Affects access to resources, achievement, and school engagement; awareness is vital for equity in support.</li>
        <li><strong>Bilingualism and ESL:</strong> Language learners may face unique cognitive and social challenges; culturally responsive instruction supports both language and content development.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender and Identity:</strong> Gender roles and expectations influence participation, confidence, and access; inclusive practices support all learners.</li>
        <li><strong>Immigration and Social Change:</strong> Recent immigrants may experience cultural dissonance, trauma, or adjustment barriers; schools play a critical role in their integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Culturally Responsive Teaching:</strong> Builds on students’ cultural knowledge and experiences; includes relevant materials, inclusive language, and equitable pedagogy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p><strong>Culturally responsive teaching</strong> means more than celebrating diversity — it requires adapting instruction to reflect students’ lived experiences and cultural strengths. Teachers should actively seek to reduce cultural bias in curriculum and assessment, foster inclusive classroom discourse, and ensure all voices are heard. Equity in education starts with understanding who your students are and responding to their realities with empathy and respect.</p>

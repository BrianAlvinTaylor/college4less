      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The cognitive perspective focuses on how people perceive, process, store, and retrieve information. It emphasizes internal mental processes such as attention, memory, problem-solving, and language — all of which influence how students learn and how instruction is most effectively delivered. Educational psychology applies these insights to create strategies that promote deep learning and conceptual understanding.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attention and Perception:</strong> Students must first attend to and interpret stimuli; selective attention influences what is encoded for memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Systems:</strong> Includes sensory memory, short-term/working memory, and long-term memory; rehearsal and chunking aid retention.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema Theory:</strong> New information is interpreted through existing cognitive frameworks (schemas); instruction is more effective when it connects to prior knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Solving and Transfer:</strong> Learning is enhanced when students can apply knowledge to novel situations; transfer is improved through practice and metacognitive strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Conceptual Change:</strong> Deep learning occurs when students replace misconceptions with accurate understanding through reflective thinking and evidence-based teaching.</li>
        <li><strong>Language and Cognition:</strong> Language development supports cognitive growth, including abstract reasoning and self-regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Techniques like scaffolding, graphic organizers, and retrieval practice align with cognitive principles and improve instructional effectiveness.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>One of the most important ideas in the cognitive perspective is <strong>schema theory</strong>—the concept that learners understand new information by relating it to existing mental frameworks. Effective instruction activates prior knowledge, which helps learners build connections and retain information more efficiently. Understanding how working memory and long-term memory function can improve both teaching strategies and study habits. Educators should also be aware that deep learning requires active processing, not just passive exposure to facts.</p>

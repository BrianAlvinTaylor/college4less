      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>American political parties have evolved dramatically from the post-Civil War period through the 21st century. Shifts in party platforms, demographics, and political coalitions have driven realignments and transformed the nation's political landscape. From Reconstruction through the New Deal to the rise of modern conservatism, the party system has continually reshaped how Americans engage with government and policy.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Themes and Movements</div>

      <h3>Reconstruction and the Solid South</h3>
      <p>Following the Civil War, the Republican Party was dominant in national politics, while Southern states remained largely Democratic due to resentment toward Reconstruction policies.</p>

      <h3>The Progressive Era (1890s–1920s)</h3>
      <p>Both major parties included progressive reformers advocating for labor rights, women's suffrage, and antitrust regulations. This era also saw the rise of third parties like the Populists.</p>

      <h3>The New Deal Coalition (1930s–1960s)</h3>
      <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Democratic Party united labor unions, minorities, and working-class Americans. This coalition dominated national politics for decades.</p>

      <h3>Southern Strategy and Political Realignment (1960s–1980s)</h3>
      <p>As Democrats supported civil rights, many white Southern voters shifted to the Republican Party, reshaping regional loyalties and voter bases.</p>

      <h3>Modern Party Polarization (1990s–Present)</h3>
      <p>Increased ideological division, the rise of conservative and progressive factions, and shifts in media and campaign strategies have heightened partisanship and voter polarization.</p>

  <div class="header">Legal History: Amendments and Supreme Court Cases</div>

  <div class="container">

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>Legal developments in the United States from the post-Civil War era through the 20th century reflected profound changes in civil rights, federal power, and social justice. From constitutional amendments to pivotal Supreme Court rulings, the legal landscape evolved in response to shifting political, economic, and cultural forces.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Key Amendments and Cases</div>

      <h3>Reconstruction Amendments</h3>
      <p>The 13th (abolition of slavery), 14th (citizenship and equal protection), and 15th (voting rights for African American men) Amendments laid the foundation for civil rights legislation, though enforcement was often weak during and after Reconstruction.</p>

      <h3>Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)</h3>
      <p>This ruling upheld state segregation laws under the "separate but equal" doctrine, legalizing racial segregation and enabling Jim Crow laws across the South.</p>

      <h3>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h3>
      <p>Overturning Plessy, this landmark case declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, setting a precedent for desegregation and civil rights advancement.</p>

      <h3>Miranda v. Arizona (1966)</h3>
      <p>This decision required law enforcement to inform individuals of their rights upon arrest, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney — known as Miranda rights.</p>

      <h3>Roe v. Wade (1973)</h3>
      <p>Recognizing a woman's constitutional right to privacy, the Court ruled in favor of access to legal abortion during the first two trimesters, fueling ongoing debates over reproductive rights.</p>

      <h3>United States v. Nixon (1974)</h3>
      <p>This unanimous ruling limited executive privilege, compelling President Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes — a decision reinforcing the principle that no one, not even the president, is above the law.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Quick Tip</div>
      <p>Be able to connect constitutional amendments and landmark cases to specific social and political movements, like Reconstruction, civil rights, or executive accountability. Remember the distinction between judicial interpretation and legislative action.</p>

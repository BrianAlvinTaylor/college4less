      <h3>New Deal Liberalism (1930s–1960s)</h3>
      <p>Championed by FDR and extended by LBJ’s Great Society, liberalism emphasized government responsibility for economic security, civil rights, and social welfare programs.</p>

      <h3>Rise of Modern Conservatism (1950s–1980s)</h3>
      <p>Figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan promoted small government, free-market capitalism, traditional values, and strong anti-communism. This movement challenged liberal dominance.</p>

      <h3>Cultural and Social Liberalism (1960s–Present)</h3>
      <p>Liberalism became closely associated with movements for civil rights, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, environmentalism, and criminal justice reform.</p>

      <h3>Conservative Resurgence and the Religious Right</h3>
      <p>Beginning in the 1980s, evangelical Christians and cultural conservatives played a major role in shaping policy debates on abortion, education, and family values.</p>

      <h3>21st Century Ideological Division</h3>
      <p>Polarization has increased, with both liberal and conservative movements using media, grassroots organizing, and legislation to advance competing visions for America’s future.</p>

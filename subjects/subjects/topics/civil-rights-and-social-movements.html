    <h1>Civil Rights and Social Movements</h1>
    <p>Exploring the fight for justice, equality, and social change in modern America</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Civil rights and social justice movements have profoundly shaped American society. From the post-Reconstruction struggles of Black Americans to women's liberation, LGBTQ+ rights, and modern activism, these movements have expanded democracy and challenged structural inequalities.</p>

    <h2>Key Movements and Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Civil Rights Movement (1950sâ€“60s): Montgomery Bus Boycott, March on Washington, Civil Rights Act of 1964</li>
      <li>Women's Rights Movement: Seneca Falls, Title IX, Roe v. Wade</li>
      <li>LGBTQ+ Advocacy: Stonewall Riots, Obergefell v. Hodges</li>
      <li>Chicano, Native American, and Asian American civil rights movements</li>
      <li>Modern activism: Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, March for Our Lives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Achievements</h2>
    <p>While progress has been made in legislation and social attitudes, civil rights remain a dynamic and ongoing struggle. Key victories include desegregation, voting rights expansion, workplace protections, and greater public representation.</p>

    <h2>Study Focus</h2>
    <p>Students preparing for U.S. History II should understand the chronology, goals, leaders, and outcomes of major civil rights movements. Connections between historical and contemporary activism are also important.</p>

    <h1>Immigration and the History of Racial and Ethnic Minorities</h1>
    <p>Understanding the evolving role of immigration and diversity in American history</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Immigration has played a central role in shaping the social, cultural, and economic fabric of the United States. From the early waves of European immigrants in the 19th century to more recent immigration from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, each group has contributed to American identity while also facing unique challenges.</p>

    <h2>Key Eras and Trends</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>19th-century immigration surges from Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia</li>
      <li>Ellis Island and Angel Island as entry points in the early 20th century</li>
      <li>Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) and other restrictive immigration laws</li>
      <li>Post-1965 Immigration and Nationality Act reforms and diversification</li>
      <li>Debates over border policy, refugee resettlement, and DACA in the 21st century</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contributions and Challenges</h2>
    <p>Immigrant communities have enriched American culture through food, language, religion, labor, and innovation. At the same time, racial and ethnic minorities often faced discrimination, segregation, and barriers to full participation in civic life. The civil rights movements of the 20th century and recent calls for equity continue to address these issues.</p>

    <h2>Study Focus</h2>
    <p>Students preparing for exams like CLEP U.S. History II should be familiar with immigration patterns, landmark legislation, social justice movements, and the role of minorities in military, politics, and labor throughout modern U.S. history.</p>

    <h1>Urbanization and Industrialization</h1>
    <p>Understanding the transformation of cities and labor in modern U.S. history</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Urbanization and industrialization were defining forces in the growth of the United States from the late 19th through the 20th century. As people moved from rural areas to cities for factory jobs, American life was reshaped by new industries, infrastructure, and demographics.</p>

    <h2>Key Developments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth of factories, mass production, and the assembly line</li>
      <li>Expansion of cities and tenement housing</li>
      <li>Labor unions, strikes, and the rise of organized labor</li>
      <li>Immigrationâ€™s role in industrial labor</li>
      <li>Transportation innovations: streetcars, subways, and automobiles</li>
      <li>Gilded Age inequality and Progressive Era responses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Social Impact</h2>
    <p>Industrial growth brought economic opportunity but also harsh working conditions, overcrowded housing, and new class divisions. Reformers and activists fought for labor protections, housing reforms, and public health improvements in growing urban centers.</p>

    <h2>Study Focus</h2>
    <p>Understand the link between industrial growth and urban change. Be able to explain how these trends shaped labor movements, immigrant experiences, and public reforms during the Progressive Era and beyond.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States shifted from a nation focused on internal growth to a global power engaging in overseas expansion. Motivated by economic interests, strategic ambitions, and cultural ideologies like the belief in American exceptionalism, this era marked the rise of American imperialism and its increasing role on the world stage.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

      <h3>Manifest Destiny</h3>
      <p>Although originally associated with westward expansion, Manifest Destiny evolved into a broader ideology that justified overseas expansion. Many Americans believed it was their national destiny to spread democracy and civilization beyond the continent.</p>

      <h3>Spanish-American War (1898)</h3>
      <p>The U.S. declared war on Spain following the sinking of the USS Maine and reports of Spanish oppression in Cuba. The victory positioned the U.S. as a colonial power, with new territories including the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.</p>

      <h3>Annexation of Hawaii (1898)</h3>
      <p>After years of growing American influence, Hawaii was formally annexed in 1898. Its strategic location in the Pacific made it vital for military and commercial purposes, especially during the growing interest in Asia-Pacific trade routes.</p>

      <h3>Philippine-American War (1899–1902)</h3>
      <p>Following the Spanish-American War, Filipino revolutionaries resisted American rule. The conflict highlighted the contradictions of promoting liberty abroad while suppressing independence movements. It marked one of the first major U.S. military engagements in Asia.</p>

      <h3>Roosevelt Corollary & Panama Canal</h3>
      <p>The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine asserted U.S. authority to intervene in Latin American affairs. This policy was demonstrated through the construction of the Panama Canal, where the U.S. supported Panamanian independence from Colombia to secure control of the canal zone.</p>

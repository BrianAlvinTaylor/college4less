      <p>Economic growth and downturns have been defining forces in U.S. history. From the industrial boom of the late 19th century to the Great Depression and postwar prosperity, the nation's economic performance has shaped social mobility, federal policy, and international influence.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Periods and Events</div>

      <h3>Gilded Age and Industrial Expansion (1870s–1900s)</h3>
      <p>Massive industrialization fueled economic growth, urbanization, and wealth accumulation—but also produced inequality, labor strife, and market instability.</p>

      <h3>The Great Depression (1929–1939)</h3>
      <p>Triggered by the 1929 stock market crash, the depression caused widespread unemployment, bank failures, and poverty. It led to massive federal intervention through FDR’s New Deal.</p>

      <h3>Post-WWII Economic Boom (1945–1970s)</h3>
      <p>America experienced strong growth, rising wages, and suburban expansion. This period solidified the U.S. middle class and consumer economy.</p>

      <h3>Stagflation and Oil Crises (1970s)</h3>
      <p>Slow growth combined with high inflation, unemployment, and energy shocks. It challenged Keynesian policies and gave rise to monetarist and supply-side approaches.</p>

      <h3>2008 Financial Crisis and Recovery</h3>
      <p>Caused by risky lending and housing speculation, this crisis led to the Great Recession. Recovery included stimulus programs, bailouts, and tighter regulations like Dodd-Frank.</p>

      <h3>COVID-19 Economic Impact (2020–2022)</h3>
      <p>The pandemic caused sudden recession, massive unemployment, and supply chain disruptions. Federal relief measures and recovery efforts were unprecedented in scope and cost.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Trends and Shifts</div>

      <h3>Urbanization and Suburbanization</h3>
      <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, millions moved to cities due to industrialization. After WWII, suburban growth surged, reshaping where Americans lived and how they commuted and consumed.</p>

      <h3>Immigration Waves</h3>
      <p>Major waves in the late 19th century (southern and eastern Europe), early 20th century restrictions (e.g., National Origins Act), and post-1965 immigration reform brought diverse populations from Latin America, Asia, and Africa.</p>

      <h3>Baby Boom and Aging Population</h3>
      <p>The post-WWII baby boom led to a large, aging population by the early 21st century, raising challenges related to healthcare, retirement, and intergenerational equity.</p>

      <h3>Racial and Ethnic Diversity</h3>
      <p>The U.S. has grown increasingly diverse, with no single racial or ethnic majority projected by mid-century. This shift influences education, culture, and politics.</p>

      <h3>Internal Migrations</h3>
      <p>Movements from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt, as well as urban-to-suburban and rural shifts, have affected regional economics, electoral politics, and infrastructure development.</p>

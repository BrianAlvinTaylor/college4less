      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>The Civil War and Reconstruction radically reshaped the American South. Following the Confederacy’s defeat in 1865, Southern states experienced a complex and turbulent reintegration into the Union. The period brought significant social, political, and economic changes, including the abolition of slavery, the rise of African American political participation, and deep resentment among white Southerners. Reconstruction policies were met with resistance, culminating in the eventual withdrawal of federal troops and the emergence of segregationist Jim Crow laws.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Themes and Events</div>

      <h3>Freedmen's Bureau</h3>
      <p>Created in 1865, the Bureau helped formerly enslaved people transition to freedom by offering education, healthcare, and legal support. It also aided poor whites in the postwar South, though it faced underfunding and opposition.</p>

      <h3>Reconstruction Amendments</h3>
      <p>The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments abolished slavery, defined citizenship, and protected voting rights. These legal transformations were monumental but often poorly enforced, especially after Reconstruction ended.</p>

      <h3>Southern Resistance</h3>
      <p>White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan used violence and intimidation to resist change. "Black Codes" were passed to limit the rights of freed people, reinforcing a racial caste system despite the formal end of slavery.</p>

      <h3>Economic Transformation</h3>
      <p>The Southern economy shifted from slavery to sharecropping, which often trapped Black families in cycles of debt and dependence. Infrastructure lay in ruins, and agricultural dependency continued without meaningful reform.</p>

      <h3>End of Reconstruction</h3>
      <p>The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction by withdrawing federal troops from the South. This allowed white Democrats to regain political control and dismantle gains made by African Americans during the Reconstruction era.</p>

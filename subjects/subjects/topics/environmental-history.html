      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>The environment has shaped American history from the nation’s founding through the 21st century. Geography influenced early colonial economies, westward expansion transformed ecosystems, and industrialization altered landscapes and air quality. In the 20th century, rising concerns about conservation, pollution, and climate led to the modern environmental movement and landmark federal legislation.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Themes and Events</div>

      <h3>Conservation Movement (Late 19th – Early 20th Century)</h3>
      <p>Leaders like John Muir and President Theodore Roosevelt emphasized protecting wilderness and managing natural resources, resulting in the creation of national parks and the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

      <h3>Dust Bowl (1930s)</h3>
      <p>A man-made environmental disaster caused by poor farming practices and drought, the Dust Bowl displaced thousands and reshaped agricultural policy in the Great Plains.</p>

      <h3>Environmental Legislation (1960s–70s)</h3>
      <p>Triggered by incidents like the Cuyahoga River fire and oil spills, Congress passed the Clean Air Act (1970), Clean Water Act (1972), and established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>

      <h3>Climate Change and Sustainability (1990s–Present)</h3>
      <p>Debates about fossil fuels, renewable energy, and environmental justice have become central to national and global policy discussions. Events like Hurricane Katrina and the Flint water crisis underscored unequal environmental burdens.</p>

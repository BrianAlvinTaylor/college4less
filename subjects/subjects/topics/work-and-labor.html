      <p>The structure of work in the United States has changed dramatically from the late 19th century to the present. Shifts from agriculture to industry to services, the rise of organized labor, and the impact of globalization and technology have shaped how Americans live and work.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Developments and Movements</div>

      <h3>Industrial Labor and Factory Work (late 1800s–early 1900s)</h3>
      <p>Urban factories transformed labor conditions, leading to long hours, low pay, and child labor. Struggles for workers' rights grew with the rise of unions like the AFL and Knights of Labor.</p>

      <h3>Labor Unrest and Reform</h3>
      <p>Strikes such as the Haymarket Riot, Pullman Strike, and Homestead Strike highlighted tensions between labor and capital. Progressive-era reforms began improving workplace safety and conditions.</p>

      <h3>New Deal Labor Protections</h3>
      <p>The Wagner Act (1935) protected union rights and collective bargaining. The Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) established minimum wage, overtime rules, and child labor bans.</p>

      <h3>Postwar Middle-Class Jobs and Union Power</h3>
      <p>Union membership peaked in the 1950s, supporting higher wages, pensions, and benefits in manufacturing, education, and public service sectors.</p>

      <h3>Deindustrialization and the Service Economy</h3>
      <p>Starting in the 1970s, many manufacturing jobs declined due to automation and outsourcing. The economy shifted toward service, tech, and gig-based labor.</p>

      <h3>Modern Labor Challenges</h3>
      <p>Union membership has declined, but new forms of labor organizing have emerged among healthcare workers, teachers, and gig economy employees.</p>

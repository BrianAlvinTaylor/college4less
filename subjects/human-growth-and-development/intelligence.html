      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Intelligence refers to a person's ability to learn, reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations. Developmental psychologists study how intelligence is defined, measured, influenced, and expressed throughout the life span—from childhood testing to adult creativity and wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concepts of Intelligence:</strong> Includes general intelligence (g), fluid vs. crystallized intelligence, multiple intelligences (Howard Gardner), and triarchic theory (Robert Sternberg).</li>
        <li><strong>Developmental Stability and Change:</strong> Intelligence shows relative stability over time, though individual scores can fluctuate due to environment, motivation, and health.</li>
        <li><strong>Heredity and Environment:</strong> Intelligence is influenced by both genetics and environment. Twin and adoption studies show strong heritability, but early childhood education, nutrition, and family support are critical.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence Tests:</strong> Common measures include the Stanford-Binet and Wechsler scales. Standardized testing is used for identifying intellectual disabilities, giftedness, and academic needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Reaction Range:</strong> Refers to the concept that genes set limits on IQ potential, but environment determines where within that range a person falls.</li>
        <li><strong>Giftedness:</strong> Typically defined as IQ ≥ 130 or exceptional talent in specific domains. Social and emotional development may not always align with cognitive maturity.</li>
        <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Often considered distinct from IQ. Associated with divergent thinking, flexibility, and originality. May peak in adolescence or early adulthood depending on the field.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Understand the difference between fluid and crystallized intelligence, the major intelligence theories, and the roles of heredity and environment. CLEP may ask about testing, giftedness, or intelligence across the life span.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Developmental psychopathology is the study of mental health conditions as they emerge and progress across the life span. This approach emphasizes how typical development can diverge, and how biological, psychological, and social factors interact to produce risk or resilience.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Conditions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):</strong> Characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Onset typically in early childhood; can persist into adulthood.</li>
        <li><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD):</strong> Involve deficits in social communication and restrictive, repetitive behaviors. Diagnosis and support often begin in early childhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Disabilities:</strong> Specific difficulties in reading, writing, or math (e.g., dyslexia). Children may have average or above-average intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Disability:</strong> Below-average intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior limitations. Can result from genetic, prenatal, or environmental factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma-Based Syndromes:</strong> Includes PTSD and other stress disorders stemming from abuse, violence, or loss. Early intervention is critical for recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Antisocial Behavior:</strong> Persistent aggression or rule-breaking. May be diagnosed as conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder in childhood and adolescence.</li>
        <li><strong>Asocial Behavior, Fears, and Phobias:</strong> Includes social withdrawal, anxiety, and irrational fears. Can emerge early and affect social development.</li>
        <li><strong>Anxiety and Mood Disorders:</strong> Depression, generalized anxiety, and bipolar disorder often emerge in adolescence or early adulthood. May require both therapy and medication.</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Disorders (including dementia):</strong> Typically associated with aging. Involve memory loss, confusion, and decline in reasoning abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Chronic Illnesses and Physical Disabilities:</strong> Medical conditions can intersect with psychological development, requiring adaptive strategies for functioning and mental health support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Focus on how developmental disorders are diagnosed and supported. CLEP may test symptoms of ADHD or ASD, or how trauma or learning disabilities affect development across stages.</p>

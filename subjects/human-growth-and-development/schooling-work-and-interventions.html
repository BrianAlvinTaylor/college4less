      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This topic explores how educational environments, occupational roles, and life transitions shape development. It also examines the role of interventions that support adaptation, learning, and well-being across the life span.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Applications of Developmental Principles:</strong> Developmental theory guides the design of educational curricula, assessment tools, and behavior support strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Styles:</strong> Individuals differ in how they process information—visual, auditory, kinesthetic. Teaching can be adapted to meet diverse needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Preschool, Day Care, and Elder Care:</strong> Early childhood education supports school readiness. Quality of care affects cognitive, emotional, and social development. Elder care focuses on autonomy, health, and social connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Operant Conditioning in Education:</strong> Reinforcement and punishment influence student behavior and motivation. Token economies and behavior modification programs are common in schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Intervention Programs and Services:</strong> Includes special education, early intervention for developmental delays, and community programs aimed at reducing risk (e.g., Head Start, IEP plans).</li>
        <li><strong>Facilitation of Role Transitions:</strong> Life stages like entering school, starting a career, becoming a parent, or retiring require adaptation. Support systems enhance success in these transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Occupational Development:</strong> Career interests and values emerge in adolescence and evolve over time. Super’s theory outlines stages of career development from exploration to disengagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Retirement:</strong> A major transition in later adulthood. Successful adjustment depends on financial security, social support, and health status.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p>Know how reinforcement applies to learning environments, and how developmental transitions like entering school or retirement are supported. CLEP questions may ask about intervention programs or educational principles.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
        <p>Slavery was foundational to the American economy and social order, especially in the South. Over time, a growing abolitionist movement challenged the moral and legal legitimacy of slavery, sparking fierce national debate and laying the groundwork for the Civil War.</p>

        <h3>The Growth of Slavery</h3>
        <p>After the Revolution, slavery expanded across the South, especially with the invention of the cotton gin in 1793. Laws reinforced the racial hierarchy and enslaved people’s lack of rights.</p>

        <h3>Resistance and Rebellion</h3>
        <p>Enslaved people resisted through escape, sabotage, and uprisings. Nat Turner’s 1831 rebellion shocked the South and led to harsher laws. The Underground Railroad helped many escape to freedom.</p>

        <h3>Abolitionist Voices</h3>
        <p>Leaders like Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, William Lloyd Garrison, and Harriet Beecher Stowe used speeches, publications, and literature to denounce slavery and galvanize support for abolition.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
        <p>The United States expanded rapidly across the North American continent during the 19th century, fueled by the ideology of Manifest Destiny. This territorial growth came at the expense of Native American nations, leading to forced removals and violent confrontations.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

        <h3>Louisiana Purchase and Lewis & Clark Expedition</h3>
        <p>In 1803, the U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, doubling its size. The Lewis and Clark expedition mapped the region and facilitated expansion westward.</p>

        <h3>Manifest Destiny</h3>
        <p>The belief that the U.S. was destined to expand from coast to coast justified territorial acquisitions and fueled conflict with Native peoples and other nations.</p>

        <h3>Indian Removal Act and Trail of Tears</h3>
        <p>Passed in 1830, this act led to the forced relocation of Native tribes to western territories. Thousands died during the journey, particularly the Cherokee in the Trail of Tears.</p>

        <h3>Texas Annexation and Mexican-American War</h3>
        <p>The U.S. annexed Texas in 1845, leading to war with Mexico. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded a large swath of the Southwest to the U.S.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
        <p>Jacksonian Democracy marked the expansion of political participation and a shift toward populist ideals in the United States. Andrew Jackson’s presidency symbolized a broader democratic movement, especially for white male citizens, while raising important issues around federal power, Native American removal, and economic policy.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

        <h3>Expanded Suffrage and the Rise of the Common Man</h3>
        <p>Property requirements for voting were reduced in many states, leading to greater voter turnout and the rise of Jackson as a symbol of the average citizen’s political voice.</p>

        <h3>Indian Removal Act (1830)</h3>
        <p>Jackson supported policies that forcibly relocated Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. The Trail of Tears, especially for the Cherokee Nation, exemplified the human cost of these policies.</p>

        <h3>Nullification Crisis</h3>
        <p>South Carolina challenged federal tariffs, prompting Jackson to assert federal supremacy while averting armed conflict through compromise legislation.</p>

        <h3>Bank War</h3>
        <p>Jackson opposed the Second Bank of the United States, seeing it as an institution that favored elites. His veto and withdrawal of federal funds destabilized the economy and led to the Panic of 1837.</p>

        <h3>Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase</h3>
        <p>Thomas Jefferson doubled the nation's size with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, despite his previous opposition to broad executive power.</p>

        <h3>War of 1812 and the Monroe Doctrine</h3>

        <p>After the failure of the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787 to establish a stronger federal government. The Bill of Rights, added in 1791, ensured protection of individual liberties and helped secure ratification by the states.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
        <p>The Articles of Confederation served as the first governing document of the United States, emphasizing state sovereignty and a weak central government. The resulting period revealed significant challenges in unifying the new nation, paving the way for the Constitutional Convention.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

        <h3>Structure and Weaknesses of the Articles</h3>
        <p>Under the Articles, Congress lacked the power to tax, regulate commerce, or enforce laws. Each state had one vote, and amendments required unanimous consent, which made national action difficult.</p>

        <h3>Economic and Foreign Policy Issues</h3>
        <p>Post-war debt, interstate tariffs, and British occupation of western forts revealed the Confederation’s inability to address national problems effectively.</p>

        <h3>Shays’ Rebellion</h3>
        <p>This 1786 uprising of farmers in Massachusetts over taxes and debt highlighted the weakness of the federal government and prompted calls for a stronger national framework.</p>

        <h3>Philadelphia Convention</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the need for reform, delegates met in 1787 to draft a new Constitution, effectively replacing the Articles and creating a more powerful central government.</p>

        <h3>Battle of Saratoga and Foreign Alliances</h3>
        <p>The American victory at Saratoga in 1777 convinced France to formally ally with the U.S., providing critical military and financial support that helped turn the tide of war.</p>

        <h3>Victory at Yorktown and Treaty of Paris</h3>
        <p>General Cornwallis’s surrender at Yorktown in 1781 effectively ended the fighting. The Treaty of Paris (1783) recognized U.S. independence and granted it territory east of the Mississippi River.</p>

        <h3>Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire</h3>
        <p>Columbus’s 1492 voyage opened the door to Spanish dominance in the New World. The encomienda system and conquests by Cortés and Pizarro reshaped the Americas, especially Central and South America.</p>

        <h3>Columbian Exchange</h3>
        <p>The global transfer of crops, animals, technology, and disease between Europe, Africa, and the Americas had long-term biological and cultural consequences—especially devastating to Native populations due to smallpox and other diseases.</p>

        <h3>French, Dutch, and English Exploration</h3>
        <p>French efforts centered on fur trading and alliances with Native peoples; Dutch settlements emphasized commerce and tolerance; and English ambitions began with failed colonies like Roanoke and culminated with Jamestown.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
        <p>Colonial America refers to the period from the early 1500s through 1776, during which European powers—especially the British—established settlements along the eastern coast of North America. These colonies developed distinct regional identities shaped by geography, economic systems, religion, and interactions with Native American societies. This era laid the foundations of American political and cultural life, culminating in calls for independence.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

        <h3>Settlement Patterns and Regional Differences</h3>
        <p>New England colonies emphasized religious communities and self-governance; the Middle Colonies developed around trade and cultural diversity; and the Southern Colonies relied heavily on plantation agriculture and enslaved labor. These patterns defined early political and economic systems in the Americas.</p>

        <h3>Relations with Native Americans</h3>
        <p>Colonists often formed alliances or engaged in conflict with Native tribes. Over time, pressure on land and resources led to increasing tension, dispossession, and violence.</p>

        <h3>Colonial Government and Self-Rule</h3>
        <p>While still subject to British authority, many colonies developed elected assemblies and local institutions, fostering a tradition of participatory government that influenced the revolutionary period.</p>

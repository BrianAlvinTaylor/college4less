      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This topic examines the core energy processes that sustain life: photosynthesis in plants and cellular respiration in both plants and animals. These biochemical pathways are critical to the flow of energy and cycling of matter within ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>Key Concepts and Structures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> A two-stage process in which light energy is converted into chemical energy. The light-dependent reactions convert solar energy into ATP and NADPH, while the light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle) fix carbon dioxide into glucose.</li>
        <li><strong>Chloroplast Structure:</strong> The site of photosynthesis, containing thylakoids (which form stacks called grana) and the surrounding fluid called stroma. Thylakoids house pigments like chlorophyll that absorb light.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Reactions:</strong> Occur in the thylakoid membranes. Water is split (photolysis) to release oxygen, and the electrons released are used to generate ATP and NADPH through the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Calvin Cycle:</strong> Takes place in the stroma. It uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into glucose through a series of enzyme-controlled steps, including carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration of RuBP.</li>
        <li><strong>Cellular Respiration:</strong> The process by which cells convert glucose into ATP. It consists of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Oxygen is essential for the complete oxidation of glucose.</li>
        <li><strong>Glycolysis:</strong> Occurs in the cytoplasm. Breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH. Does not require oxygen.</li>
        <li><strong>Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):</strong> Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Processes pyruvate into CO<sub>2</sub> and transfers energy to NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, which carry electrons to the ETC.</li>
        <li><strong>Electron Transport Chain (ETC):</strong> Takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> pass through protein complexes, releasing energy used to pump H<sup>+</sup> ions and drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor, forming water.</li>
        <li><strong>Anaerobic Respiration:</strong> In the absence of oxygen, cells undergo fermentation. In animals, this produces lactic acid; in yeast, alcohol and CO<sub>2</sub>. Yields much less ATP than aerobic respiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Balance:</strong> Aerobic respiration yields up to 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule, while anaerobic yields only 2 ATP. Photosynthesis stores energy in glucose; respiration releases that energy for cellular work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <div class="tip">
        Don’t confuse where each process happens: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts (plants only); cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria (both plants and animals). Know the stages and where ATP is produced.

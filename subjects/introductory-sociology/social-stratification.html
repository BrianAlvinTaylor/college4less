      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Social stratification refers to the structured inequality between different groups in society. It is a system by which society ranks people in a hierarchy based on class, status, race, gender, and other factors. Stratification affects life chances, access to resources, and social mobility, and it is reproduced across generations through institutional practices.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Class:</strong> A group of people with similar levels of wealth, income, education, and occupational prestige. Includes upper, middle, working, and lower classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Mobility:</strong> Movement within a social hierarchy — vertical (up/down) or horizontal (within a level); can be intergenerational or intragenerational.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems of Stratification:</strong> Includes caste systems, class systems, and meritocracies. Some systems are closed (rigid), others open (more mobility).</li>
        <li><strong>Race and Ethnic Relations:</strong> Patterns of inequality based on racial and ethnic identity. Explores prejudice, discrimination, institutional racism, and cultural pluralism.</li>
        <li><strong>Sex and Gender Roles:</strong> Examines gender as a social construct, patriarchy, gender socialization, gender identity, and intersectionality with other social categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Aging and Stratification:</strong> Social roles and expectations around aging, ageism, and the economic and social challenges faced by older adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Occupations and Professions:</strong> Stratification within the labor market; looks at job prestige, professionalization, and inequalities in access to career advancement.</li>
        <li><strong>Power and Inequality:</strong> The ability to control resources and decision-making processes. Explores authority, domination, and resistance through sociological theory (Marx, Weber, Bourdieu).</li>
        <li><strong>Reproduction of Inequality:</strong> Inequality is maintained through social institutions (education, family, media) and cultural capital (values, norms, and behaviors rewarded by society).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p><strong>Stratification is not just about money — it’s about power, access, and opportunity.</strong> Social hierarchies are maintained by systems and institutions that reward some groups while marginalizing others. Recognizing how inequality is structured and reproduced is central to understanding modern society.</p>

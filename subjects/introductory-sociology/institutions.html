      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Social institutions are enduring systems of organized social roles and norms that fulfill key functions in society. They shape our behavior, values, and expectations, and help maintain social order. Major institutions—like family, education, religion, economy, politics, and healthcare—interact and evolve alongside broader cultural, economic, and technological changes.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> Primary agent of socialization. Includes nuclear, extended, single-parent, and chosen families. Examines kinship, marriage patterns, and gender roles within households.</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Transmits knowledge, values, and social norms. Includes formal schooling and hidden curriculum (e.g., obedience, competition). Explores stratification and access based on race, class, and geography.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Provides moral frameworks, social cohesion, and community. Sociologists study secularization, fundamentalism, civil religion, and the role of religion in social conflict and unity.</li>
        <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Concerned with production, distribution, and consumption of goods. Includes capitalism, socialism, globalization, labor markets, and economic inequality.</li>
        <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Examines power, authority, and governance. Includes forms of government, political participation, ideology, and how policies impact social groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare/Medicine:</strong> Investigates how health and illness are socially constructed. Includes access to care, the sick role, medicalization, and health disparities by race, class, and gender.</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional Interdependence:</strong> Institutions are interlinked—for example, education influences economic opportunity; healthcare policy affects family well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Change and Institutions:</strong> Institutions evolve with social movements, demographic shifts, and technological innovation. Resistance to or adaptation of change reflects power dynamics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Tip</h2>
      <p><strong>Institutions structure society by organizing our relationships and expectations.</strong> Each institution addresses basic human needs while reinforcing cultural norms. Understanding how they operate—and how they are shaped by and shape inequality—is key to analyzing society as a whole.</p>

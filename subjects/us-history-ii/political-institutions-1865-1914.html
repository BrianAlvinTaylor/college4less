      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Following the Civil War, the U.S. faced the challenge of reconstructing the Union and redefining citizenship. This era saw dramatic shifts in political institutions, from Reconstruction governments and constitutional amendments to Gilded Age politics, patronage reform, and the beginnings of federal regulation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reconstruction Politics:</strong> The federal government temporarily imposed military rule on the South and passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. Radical Republicans pushed for civil rights, while white resistance and "Redeemer" governments restored Democratic control and enacted Jim Crow laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Rise of Segregation:</strong> The Supreme Court's <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> (1896) decision legalized segregation under the doctrine of "separate but equal," reinforcing systemic racial discrimination.</li>
        <li><strong>Gilded Age Partisanship:</strong> Political machines like Tammany Hall controlled urban politics. Patronage dominated federal appointments until the Pendleton Civil Service Act (1883) began reform.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion of Federal Power:</strong> The Interstate Commerce Act (1887) and Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) signaled early efforts to regulate business and promote competition in response to monopolies and public outcry.</li>
        <li><strong>Populist Movement:</strong> Farmers and laborers, angry over economic inequality and political corruption, formed the Populist Party, calling for government ownership of railroads, direct election of senators, and currency reform.</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive Reformers (early 1900s):</strong> Political activists began pushing for transparency, anti-corruption measures, and social justice, setting the stage for the Progressive Era.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Since 1915, the structure and power of American political institutions have expanded significantly. The federal government grew during wars and economic crises, the judiciary shaped civil rights, and political realignments redefined party systems. These developments reflect tensions between liberty, security, and the evolving role of government in American life.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expansion of Federal Power:</strong> The New Deal (1930s) dramatically increased federal intervention in the economy. Programs like Social Security and the FDIC institutionalized public welfare and regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>World Wars and Executive Power:</strong> War measures expanded presidential authority in foreign and domestic policy. The Cold War further centralized national security decision-making in the executive branch.</li>
        <li><strong>Supreme Court Decisions:</strong> Landmark rulings expanded civil liberties and rights, including <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954), <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> (1966), and <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973). Later cases reshaped campaign finance and affirmative action.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Realignments:</strong> The New Deal coalition dominated mid-century politics, later replaced by conservative resurgence with Ronald Reagan. Partisan divisions intensified in the 21st century.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislation and Reform:</strong> Major acts included the Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965), War Powers Act (1973), and more recently, healthcare reform (Affordable Care Act, 2010).</li>
        <li><strong>Federalism and States’ Rights:</strong> Ongoing debates over healthcare, education, and environmental policy reflect tensions between state and federal authority.</li>
      </ul>

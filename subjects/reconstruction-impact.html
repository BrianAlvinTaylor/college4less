      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>The Reconstruction era marked a critical moment in U.S. history as the federal government sought to reintegrate Southern states and secure rights for newly freed African Americans. This period included both promising reforms and significant setbacks, setting the stage for future civil rights struggles.</p>

      <div class="section-title">Key Events and Concepts</div>

      <h3>13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments</h3>
      <p>These constitutional amendments abolished slavery (13th), granted citizenship and equal protection under the law (14th), and protected voting rights regardless of race (15th). Together, they redefined civil rights in the U.S. and became a foundation for future legal battles against discrimination.</p>

      <h3>Freedmen's Bureau</h3>
      <p>Created in 1865, the Bureau helped newly freed African Americans transition from slavery to freedom. It provided food, housing, education, and legal assistance. Although underfunded and short-lived, it laid the groundwork for future social welfare programs.</p>

      <h3>Military Reconstruction Acts</h3>
      <p>Passed in 1867, these laws divided the South into five military districts to enforce federal policies and oversee new state constitutions that upheld civil rights. This was a direct response to Southern resistance and a push to ensure compliance with new federal standards.</p>

      <h3>Impeachment of Andrew Johnson</h3>
      <p>Johnson, who opposed many Republican Reconstruction efforts, was impeached by the House in 1868 for violating the Tenure of Office Act. Though he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote, his presidency symbolized the conflict between executive and legislative visions for Reconstruction.</p>

      <h3>Rise of the Ku Klux Klan and Black Codes</h3>
      <p>Despite federal reforms, white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan used terror to suppress Black political power. Simultaneously, Black Codes were enacted in Southern states to restrict the freedoms of African Americans and maintain pre-war social hierarchies under a new name.</p>

      <p>Focus on how Reconstruction policies impacted both federal-state relations and civil rights—this dual theme often appears in exam questions.</p>

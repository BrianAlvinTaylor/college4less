      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>Legal history in the United States is shaped by key constitutional amendments and landmark Supreme Court decisions that redefined civil liberties, federal power, and social justice. From expanding voting rights to dismantling racial segregation, the legal system has played a pivotal role in shaping American society during the late 19th and 20th centuries.</p>

      <h3>14th Amendment</h3>
      <p>Ratified in 1868, the 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship and guaranteed equal protection under the law. It became a cornerstone for many civil rights cases, expanding federal authority to protect individual rights against state laws.</p>

      <h3>Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)</h3>
      <p>This Supreme Court decision upheld state segregation laws under the doctrine of "separate but equal." It legitimized racial segregation and set the stage for nearly 60 years of legalized discrimination until it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education.</p>

      <h3>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h3>
      <p>This landmark case declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, overturning Plessy v. Ferguson. The unanimous decision marked a major victory for the civil rights movement and paved the way for school desegregation across the country.</p>

      <h3>Voting Rights Act of 1965</h3>
      <p>Though not a Supreme Court case, this legislation enforced the 15th Amendment by banning discriminatory voting practices such as literacy tests. It dramatically increased voter registration and participation among African Americans, especially in the South.</p>

      <h3>Roe v. Wade (1973)</h3>
      <p>This controversial decision recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion under the right to privacy. It established a precedent that influenced debates over reproductive rights for decades, though it was later overturned in 2022 by Dobbs v. Jackson.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Mastery of Standard Written English is essential for clear, effective academic writing. This topic focuses on the grammatical rules, sentence structures, and stylistic choices that form the foundation of college-level essays. Whether you're editing a draft or constructing a new argument, understanding these conventions will ensure that your writing is precise and professional.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Areas of Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentence Structure:</strong> Avoid sentence fragments, run-ons, and comma splices. Every sentence needs a subject and verb, and ideas should be clearly connected.</li>
        <li><strong>Subject-Verb Agreement:</strong> Make sure singular subjects have singular verbs and plural subjects have plural verbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Pronoun Clarity:</strong> Ensure pronouns clearly refer to a specific noun (antecedent) and agree in number and gender.</li>
        <li><strong>Verb Tense Consistency:</strong> Maintain consistent tense unless a shift is necessary for clarity or context.</li>
        <li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Place modifiers next to the words they modify to avoid confusion (e.g., "She almost failed every class" vs. "She failed almost every class").</li>
        <li><strong>Punctuation:</strong> Use commas, semicolons, colons, and dashes accurately to structure your writing and prevent ambiguity.</li>
        <li><strong>Diction and Idiom:</strong> Use words correctly and naturally. Avoid confusing idiomatic expressions or misused words.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <div class="examples">
      <h2>Common Errors and Fixes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Everyone need to submit their essay by Friday.<br><strong>Correct:</strong> Everyone needs to submit his or her essay by Friday. (or: their, if accepted in your academic setting)</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The dog barked loudly it scared the baby.<br><strong>Correct:</strong> The dog barked loudly, and it scared the baby.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> She gave the book to Tom and I.<br><strong>Correct:</strong> She gave the book to Tom and me.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Read your writing aloud. If something sounds awkward or confusing, there's a good chance it needs revision for clarity, grammar, or structure.

      <h2>Practice Prompt</h2>

      <div class="examples">

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>From the early colonial period to the American Revolution, the political institutions and public policies of what became the United States developed through a combination of inherited British traditions and locally driven innovation. Colonists formed representative assemblies, challenged imperial control, and eventually articulated the foundations of American constitutional government.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Colonial Charters and Local Government:</strong> Each colony operated under a charter granted by the British Crown. Colonists formed elected assemblies, like Virginia’s House of Burgesses (1619), which marked the beginnings of self-rule in North America.</li>
        <li><strong>Town Meetings and Direct Democracy:</strong> Especially in New England, colonists engaged in local governance through town meetings that influenced broader democratic traditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Imperial Control and Colonial Resistance:</strong> As the British government increased regulation (e.g., Navigation Acts, Proclamation of 1763), colonial resistance grew, particularly after the Stamp Act (1765) and Intolerable Acts (1774).</li>
        <li><strong>First and Second Continental Congresses:</strong> These intercolonial assemblies coordinated responses to British policies and began moving toward independence. The Second Congress ultimately adopted the Declaration of Independence in 1776.</li>
        <li><strong>The Articles of Confederation:</strong> America’s first constitution created a weak central government and demonstrated the challenges of governing a new nation without strong federal authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Constitutional Thought and Debates:</strong> Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, colonial leaders like Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton developed political philosophies about liberty, representation, and the rule of law that would shape the U.S. Constitution.</li>
      </ul>

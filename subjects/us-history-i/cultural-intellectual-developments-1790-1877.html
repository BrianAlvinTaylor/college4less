      <ul>
        <li><strong>Second Great Awakening:</strong> A major religious revival that emphasized personal salvation, emotional preaching, and egalitarian faith. It led to increased church membership and spurred reform movements like temperance and abolition.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcendentalism and Literature:</strong> Philosophers like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau stressed individualism and a spiritual connection to nature. Their works helped define American literary culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> Leaders like Horace Mann advocated universal public schooling as essential to democracy. Literacy expanded, and regional disparities in education began to narrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Women and Reform:</strong> Women played leading roles in temperance, abolition, and suffrage. Writers like Margaret Fuller advanced early feminist thought.</li>
        <li><strong>Nationalism in Art and History:</strong> Artists like those in the Hudson River School celebrated American landscapes. Historians like George Bancroft promoted patriotic interpretations of U.S. history.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Impact of War:</strong> The Civil War shaped national memory and inspired poetry, music, and memorial traditions. Postwar, there was a push to define unity and citizenship in cultural terms.</li>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The social landscape of early America was shaped by a complex mix of indigenous cultures, European colonization, forced migration through slavery, and evolving family, religious, and gender roles. These developments laid the groundwork for the nation's diversity, inequalities, and early social institutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Themes and Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indigenous Societies:</strong> Before European contact, Native American societies were culturally and linguistically diverse. They practiced varied economies and political systems, ranging from nomadic bands to complex confederacies like the Iroquois League.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact of Colonization:</strong> European arrival led to demographic collapse through disease and warfare, displacement, and cultural disruption. The Columbian Exchange introduced new crops, animals, and technologies, but also entrenched inequality.</li>
        <li><strong>Slavery and Resistance:</strong> The transatlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to the Americas. Enslaved people maintained cultural traditions and resisted oppression through rebellion, escape, and sabotage.</li>
        <li><strong>Women and Family Life:</strong> Women's roles varied by region and class. In New England, Puritan norms emphasized patriarchy, while in the South, plantation life shaped gender roles differently. Native and African women had distinct cultural identities and labor roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Immigration and Ethnic Diversity:</strong> Colonies attracted settlers from England, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, and elsewhere. Religious and ethnic communities shaped regional identities, such as Quakers in Pennsylvania or Catholics in Maryland.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion and Social Order:</strong> Religion played a central role in colonial life, especially in Puritan New England. The Great Awakening (1730s–40s) challenged established churches and promoted individual piety, egalitarianism, and revivalism.</li>
      </ul>

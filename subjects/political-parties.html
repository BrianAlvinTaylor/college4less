      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>From Reconstruction through the 20th century, American political parties evolved dramatically in response to economic changes, social movements, and shifting voter demographics. New party alignments and grassroots movements transformed the nation's political landscape and influenced federal policy.</p>

      <h3>Third Party Challenges</h3>
      <p>Movements like the Populist Party (1890s) and Progressive Party (1912) emerged to challenge the two-party system. These parties advocated for reforms such as direct election of senators, banking reform, labor rights, and regulation of monopolies.</p>

      <h3>New Deal Coalition</h3>
      <p>During Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, a broad coalition of working-class voters, minorities, Southern Democrats, and urban intellectuals unified under the Democratic Party. This alliance shaped American politics for decades and expanded the role of the federal government.</p>

      <h3>Southern Realignment</h3>
      <p>In response to civil rights legislation in the 1960s, many white Southern voters shifted from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. This realignment redefined regional party loyalty and contributed to a more ideologically polarized political map.</p>

      <h3>Rise of Conservative Movement</h3>
      <p>In the 1980s, under leaders like Ronald Reagan, the conservative movement emphasized tax cuts, deregulation, strong national defense, and traditional values. It solidified Republican support among evangelical Christians and business leaders.</p>

      <h3>Modern Political Polarization</h3>
      <p>In recent decades, increasing partisan division has led to gridlock, highly charged elections, and deep ideological divides between major parties. Voter identity, media influence, and social issues continue to drive modern realignment.</p>
